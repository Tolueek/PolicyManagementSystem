# Insurance Management System

This project simulates an insurance policy management system. It includes classes for managing policyholders, products, and payments.

## Files:
- `policyholder.py`: Class for managing policyholder data and actions (register, suspend, reactivate).
- `product.py`: Class for managing products (create, update, suspend, reactivate).
- `payment.py`: Class for handling payments (process, reminders, penalties).
- `main.py`: Demonstrates how to use the classes with sample data.

## How to Run:
1. Make sure all Python files (`policyholder.py`, `product.py`, `payment.py`, `main.py`) are in the same folder.
2. Run `main.py` to see the functionality in action:
   ```bash
   python main.py
